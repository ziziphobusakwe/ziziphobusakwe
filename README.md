I come from an applied statistics background (UCT) that positioned me to provide research & analytics support in sales teams in the asset management space. I "stumbled" into programming looking for ways to shave off non-differentiating workloads that took up a significant amount of my time & that of my teammates.

In the process, I really enjoyed teaching myself how to code & discovering new technologies. Ultimately, it was the impact of using the technologies (to automate some work, deliver helpful insights and extend the functionality of some applications that we were using) that inspired my journey to pivot to being a full-time ‚Äútechie‚Äù.

Between Sept. ‚Äò21 & Dec. ‚Äô22, I focused on investing time to build my programming & engineering skills through a rigorous, self-directed, peer-to-peer & project-based, 16-month software engineering course at the WeThinkCode_ academy. This has been followed by a challenging yet fun practical application of what I've learned thus far in my current role as a backend software developer intern at NML ‚Äì a specialist financial services software development company.

I am proficient in Python & Java in addition to a working knowledge of C#, CSS, HTML, JS, SQL & other key tools, techniques & technologies. I am mostly interested in backend development, cloud computing (AWS) & data science while keeping an open mind to other opportunities.

I am a mature young lady who communicates well & knows how to deliver & work well with others in a team. Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, long-distance running & reading for a healthy, discerning, positive & growth-geared mind
