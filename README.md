- 👋 Hi, I’m @ziziphobusakwe
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python & java @ WeThinkCode_
- 👀 I’m interested in technologies that will enable the transformation of financial services in Africa. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any data science project (I have a rusty stats degree begging me to put it to use 
     plus I find the stuff really interesting). Also keen to build solutions for financial services in Africa.
