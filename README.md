I come from an applied statistics background that positioned me to provide research & analytics support in sales teams in the asset management space. I "stumbled" into programming looking for ways to shave off non-differentiating work loads that took up a significant amount of my time & that of my teammates. 

In the process, I really enjoyed teaching myself how to code & discovering new technologies. Ultimately, it was the impact from using all these tools (to automate work loads, deliver helpful insights and extend the functionality of the applications that we were using) that inspired my journey to being a full time techie. 

Since September 2021, I have been investing time to build on my tech skills through a self-directed & project based Software Engineering 16-month Program at WeThinkCode_. 

I am now proficient in Java & Python in addition to a working knowledge of SQL, CSS, HTML & Java Script. I am mostly interested in work that involves backend development, cloud computing &/or data science, while keeping an open mind to other opportunities. 

I am a matured and responsible young lady who communicates well & knows how to deliver & be helpful in a team. Outside of work I enjoy light hikes, long distance running and reading for leisure.
